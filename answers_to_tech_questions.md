	•	How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

    I spent approximately 22 hours on this solution

      > 6 hours on researching and testing a node js scraper that would work with Heroku 
      > 8 hours integrating the APIs and deploying on Heroku 
      > 8 hours of coding the front-end with React and CSS          

    Given more time, I would 
      > find a scraper that would be able to work when deployed, or debug my implementation to ensure it worked deployed.
      > improve error handling
      > write unit tests for components and functions
      > use SASS to organize the css
      

	•	What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

      spread operator in JavaScript is the most useful thing that got added in the ES6 update.  In Demo.js, I use this feature to easily merge new search results into an array.  

	•	How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

      Assuming the behavior has been isolated and is replicable, I would first do a trace on the components that in question, and then investigate why the performance is slow.   

	•	How would you improve the API that you just used?

      I would add a free trial so developers know what they are getting into.  In my experience, the best way to get the most out of an API is to read the docs and use it over and over.
